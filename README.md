# About Us

Following many successful years as Licenced Electrical Contractors and noticing huge changes in the way that electrical product was purchased and supplied, the idea of online selling led to the establishment of Electrotraders.

Electrotraders supports both trade users and individuals who are purchasing product for a professional finish or those who are installing their own equipment where permitted to do so.

Manufactured or assembled items such as Extension Leads, Power Boards & Adapters and Appliance Leads are produced in-house by Electrotraders Licenced Electricians.

Electrotraders is fast becoming the supplier of choice to our many thousands of happy customers.

## Trading Hours

We are open from Monday to Friday from 8am until 4pm for pick-up of Click & Collect orders.
